Blender Cloud Addon
===================

Congratulations on downloading the Blender Cloud addon. For your
convenience, we have bundled it with the Blender ID addon.

To use the Blender Cloud addon, perform the following steps:

- Use Blender (File, User Preferences, Addons, Install from file)
  to install blender_id-x.x.x.addon.zip

- If you had a previous version of the Blender Cloud addon installed,
  restart Blender now.

- Log in with your Blender ID.

- Use Blender to install blender_cloud-x.x.x.addon.zip

    If you don't see the addon in the list, enable the Testing
    category.

- Press Ctrl+Alt+Shift+A to start the texture browser.

- Visit the User Preferences, Addons panel, to use the Blender Sync
  feature.


Support for Blenders not from blender.org
-----------------------------------------

Maybe you use Blender from another source than blender.org, such as an
Ubuntu package. If that is the case, you have to make sure that the
Python package "requests" is installed. On Ubuntu Linux this can be
done with the command

    sudo apt-get install python3-requests

On other platforms & distributions this might be different.

Blender uses Python 3.5, so make sure you install the package for the
correct version of Python.


Subscribing to the Blender Cloud
--------------------------------

The Blender Sync feature is free to use for everybody with a Blender
ID account. In order to use the Texture Browser you need to have a
Blender Cloud subscription. If you didn't subscribe yet, go to:

    https://cloud.blender.org/join
