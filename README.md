Blender Cloud addon
===================

Installation requires the [Pillar SDK](https://github.com/armadillica/pillar-python-sdk)
to be installed. It can either be installed regularly somewhere on
the Python PATH, or be stored as a [wheel file](http://pythonwheels.com/)
at `blender_cloud/pillar_sdk-*.whl`.
